Kini Wakini
Where fiction meets reality, and every frame listens to the human heart.

PRODUCER — DIRECTOR — CREATIVE WRITER — STORYTELLER — ACTOR
About Me
I am a Kenyan storyteller working across fiction and documentary, with a particular focus on **people-driven projects** that explore social, environmental, lifestyle and medical themes. My practice blends cinematic craft and emotional truth — I make films that move hearts and shape minds. I am dedicated to elevating authentic African perspectives, utilising cinematic language to challenge inherited narratives and platform local voices that resonate globally.

My training and experience as an actor provides a unique foundation for my directing work; I prioritise performance-driven narratives and collaborate closely with talent to extract truly nuanced and authentic emotional truth on screen. While fiction holds a special place in my heart, I am deepening my documentary practice. Truthful, well-crafted nonfiction is a powerful tool to surface under-represented stories, highlight injustices, and catalyse social change. This holistic practice is continually refined through professional development, including **five** producing and directing **documentary workshops (Docubox)**. My fiction training includes the **One Fine Day Actor’s Workshop** and the **Multichoice Talent Factory Directors Workshop**, complemented by **specialised** training in **Dolby Sound Design (Multichoice Africa)**.

What People Say
"We were simply wowed. Kini has the exceptional ability to take a complex conversation—like climate action—and make it simple, entertaining, and profoundly easy to understand. It takes a truly creative and forward-thinking mind to actualise that."

- Simon Wachira, Chairman (VCA)

Remark on *Our Planet, Our Future*, a Tabianchi Climate Action Grant project.

"I really like how Kini Wakini does not think in a linear perspective. Her creativity is wide, and if anyone needs their story workshopped before they lock it for shooting, they should contact her."

- Dieudo Hamadi, Documentary Filmmaker

Personal remark made after a Docubox workshop.

"Your writing has this rare, natural rhythm—conversational yet deeply reflective, funny yet quietly profound... You bring out emotion without forcing it, and your humour feels effortless—like it flows straight from your soul. You don’t just tell stories—you live them on the page. That’s what great writers do."

- Gitigi Mwangi, Kenyan Physicist
